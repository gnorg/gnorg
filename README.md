moin, i'm @gnorg âœŒ

I'm a cinematographer, tinkerer and co-founder of Heinrig, fritz kola addict, and get fascinated by tech a bit too fast.

If you don't see me with a camera, I'm producing sustainable film tech at [heinrig.tech](https://heinrig.tech) or I'm enjoying the sun on a road bike.

You can find my filmmaker work [here](https://gilstein.de).
